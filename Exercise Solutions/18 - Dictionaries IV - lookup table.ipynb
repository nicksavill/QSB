    "DNA is double stranded. The two strands are complementary, so an A on one strand pairs with a T on the other strand, and G pairs with C. So given one strand, say \"AACCGGTT\" we know that its complement will be \"TTGGCCAA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A DNA sequence is said to be palindromic if its reverse complement is the same as the DNA sequence. For example, the DNA sequence \"ATGATCAT\" is palindromic because its complement is \"TACTAGTA\", which, when reversed, is \"ATGATCAT\".\n",
